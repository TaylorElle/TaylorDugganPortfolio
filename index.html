          <h1>Hi. I'm Taylor Duggan!</h1>
          <p>
            After getting my Bachelor's degree in Psychology and spending over 8
            years in the non-profit and humanitarian aid sector, I knew it was
            time to go after a new challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            I took advantage of COVID-caused unemployment and went after a
            long-time dream - to become a software engineer. Through Thinkful
            and other avenues, I have been learning Full Stack Web Development
            and building my portfolio.

          <p>
            I am ecstatic at the avenues in which Developers can create products
            and solve problems. I am most excited for the innovations that can
            be made for people around the world. There's so much to learn and
            it's an honor to be part of a team to make this happen.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I'm not coding, I spend my time gardening, tackling HIIT
            workouts, running, and painting functional art. Even my hobbies show
            my love for creating and developing things to be the best they can
            be.

          </h3>
          <p>
            This is an Alarm Clock App I built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            Forcing the user to complete different actions (i.e. math problems,
            popping bubbles, etc) each day to turn the alarm off, it is for
            user's that need extra assistance waking up. I learned to use
            different APIs with this App to accomplish the goal of having
            different problems each day.

          <p>
            This is a Calendar App I built. Using React, this allows users to
            share their calendar with their closest friends. For users that
            travel often, friends can share their itinerary with each other and
            make plans for when they're in the same location. I learned how to
            link this App with Google Maps.

          <p>
            This is a website I built for a candle company. Using Bootstrap,
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this candle company can display and sell
            their wares to users in the USA. I learned how to create a secure
            shopping experience for guest and returning users.

          <p>
            I created an app for a Chiropractic office that does not make
            appointments. Users can join a waitlist that will tell them when the
            doctor is ready to see them. I learned how to implement to user
            types for this application (i.e. doctor and patient) to allow for
            different commands by each.
